Welcome to the homepage of the Bonner Lab! I am an Assistant Professor in Environmetrics jointly appointed between the <a href="http://www.stats.uwo.ca/" target="_blank">Department of Statistical and Actuarial Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.uwo.ca/biology/" target="_blank">Department of Biology</a> at the <a href="http://www.uwo.ca" target="_blank">University of Western Ontario</a> where I started in July, 2015. Before this time I was an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://stat.as.uky.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a> at the <a href="http://www.uky.edu" target="_blank">University of Kentucky</a> for four and a half years, held a post-doc in the [Department of Statistics](http://stat.ubc.ca/) at the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a> for two years, and completed my PhD in the <a href="http://stat.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science</a> at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca" target="_blank">Simon Fraser University</a>.

Our work focuses on developing and helping researchers to implement novel methodology for analysing ecological data. In particular, my work focuses on hierarchical models fit in a Bayesian framework via advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. My primary area of application has been the analysis of data from mark-recapture experiments that are crucial for monitoring populations of wild animals and my interest in this work is driven by my concerns about the impacts of humans on the natural environment. The students in my lab are involved in a variety of projects, both applied and theoretical in nature, and we also work on several group projects. Current collaborations involve the analysis of data from [whale sharks in Australia](http://www.whaleshark.org/), [snakes and salmanders in Kentucky,](http://www2.ca.uky.edu/forestry/Price/Home/price_home.html) [cliff swallows in Nebraska](http://www.utulsa.edu/academics/colleges/college-of-engineering-and-natural-sciences/departments-and-schools/Department-of-Biological-Science/Our-Faculty-and-Staff/B/Charles-Brown.aspx), and [lizards on islands in the Spanish Mediterranean](http://imedea.uib-csic.es/ficha.php?pid=387&c=abme). It&#8217;s a shame we don&#8217;t get to visit all the field sites!
