Yesterday my [paper with Danielle Bridger and Mark Briffa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25673676) got coverage in [Discover Magazine](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/inkfish/2015/03/03/shy-crabs-make-the-most-sperm/#.VPfFlMt0Qgn "Shy Crabs Make the Most Sperm"). I have to admit that it was Danielle and Mark who &#8220;peeked inside the crabsâ€™ gonads&#8221;. I just helped out with the statistics.
